# AI Development Reflection: PollResultChart Component

## Symbol Used
- **@AI**: Used as a comment anchor to prompt Cursor's AI for component generation

## What the AI Produced
The AI prompt generated a comprehensive React component with:
- TypeScript interfaces using the `PollResults` type from `@/types/poll`
- Responsive bar chart visualization with CSS-based progress bars
- Vote counts and percentage calculations
- Proper component structure with Card UI components
- Smooth transitions and responsive design
- Clean separation of concerns with props interface

## What Worked Well
- **Type Safety**: The AI correctly utilized the existing `PollResults` type and created a proper `PollResultChartProps` interface
- **Visual Design**: Generated clean, accessible bar charts with proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- **Responsive Layout**: Used Tailwind classes effectively for mobile-friendly design

## What Didn't Work Well
- **Limited Context**: The AI couldn't access the full codebase context, so it created a generic solution rather than leveraging existing patterns from the app
- **No Real Chart Library**: Used basic CSS bars instead of a proper charting library like Chart.js or Recharts, which might be needed for more complex visualizations

## Key Learnings
- Symbol anchors (`@AI`) are effective for targeted component generation
- AI excels at creating well-structured, typed components when given clear requirements
- Consider providing more context about existing patterns and libraries for better integration
